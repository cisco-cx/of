  alert_severity_threshold: minor
  ## apic.drop_unknown_alerts if set to true will cause this client to drop any unknown faults coming
  ## from the APICs that aren't listed in the alerts dictionary. Defaults to false
  drop_unknown_alerts: true

defaults:
  ## defaults.alert_severity is the severity to use when alert not mapped in this config.
  ## You must use a syslog severity value, e.g. "error", in this field.
  alert_severity: error

  ## NOTE: Annotations operations will be implemented in a future release.

alerts:
  apicFabricSelectorIssuesConfig:  ## human-defined alert name
    ## alertSeverity at this level is the human-defined alert severity for a given alert.

  ## Default Value of `subsystem` label in alert, when `identify_node.enabled = true`
  # To set subsystem when `identify_node.enabled = false`, use the static label feature.
